## Introduction
This app was designed to help small groups of people experiment with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I developed this app as a tool to allow potential Nucamp Jumpstart Coding Workshop attendees to dip their feet in the water with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Specs
This app was built using React, Vite, Monaco Editor, and a Babel standalone compiler.
